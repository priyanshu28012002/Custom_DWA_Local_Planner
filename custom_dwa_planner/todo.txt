dwa_implementation Steps


Get current state
Generate velocity samples
Gentnerate multipal trajectory 
Pick trajectory with highest score of costfuncation base on 
heading_to_goal_score toword the gole in correct orientation
clearance_score obstrical in the costmap
velocity_score 
Select best velocity
Publish the cmd_vel
